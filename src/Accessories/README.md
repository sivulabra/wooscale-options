# Accessories

There are two kinds of accessories that this plugin offers: tangible and intangible. The difference between the two is simple: tangible accessories are linked to a different product that is added to WooCommerce, while intangible accessories are abstract, meaning that they are not linked to any product in WooCommerce.
